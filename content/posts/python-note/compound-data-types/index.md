- __Compound Data Type__ is a data made from collection of various data types like strings, integers, etc.
- __Compound Data Types__ in Python can be represented by __List__, __Dictionary__, __Tuple__, __Set__.
- Tools I can use to work with __Compound Data Types__ are __Iterators__, __For loops__, __While loops__, and other __Functions__


### __List__

   - Using square brackets \[ \] 
   - The elements are separated by comma
   - Maintain order of the elements 
   - Using index to access the elements
   - Mutable, the elements can be change

   `[1, 2, 3, 1, True, "Kei", "Mars", 0.5, None]`
   

### __Dictionary__

   - Using curly braces { }
   - No indexing
   - Maintain order of the elements
   - The elements are in key:value pair format
   - Using key to access the value
   - Key can be string or integer, but it has to be immutable data type

   `{"name":"Mars", "age":4, "color":"black", "hobby":"barking"}`



### __Set__

   - Using curly braces { }
   - The elements are separated by comma
   - No duplicate value allowed
   - No order, the position of the elements change each time 
   - No indexing because Set doesn't have order

   `{1, 2, 3, True, "Kei", "Mars", 0.5, None}`



### __Tuple__

   - Using parentheses ( )
   - Immutable, the elements can't be change
   - Maintain order of the elements
   - Using index to acess the elements

   `(1, 2, 3, True, "Kei", "Mars", 0.5, None)`
